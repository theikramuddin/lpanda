# **App Name**: LPANDA

## Core Features:

- Animated Paper Altar: Display a looping animated texture to recall paper.
- Image Display: Showcase a static, randomly chosen LPANDA meme/artwork.
- About Us/Shop Link: Include a section that describes what LPANDA is about. Offer a link to an offsite shop.
- Suggest a Donation Amount: AI powered. Using the name/description of an offering provided by the user, use a tool that suggests what donation amount best aligns with that offering. Provide three responses representing high, medium, and low estimates of offering value. Note that donations do not actually occur within the application.
- User Offering Form: Form where user may specify an offering for which they want to know the best donation amount

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dusty orange (#C36F09), suggestive of paper.
- Background color: Very light off-white (#F3F0EC), a muted shade suggestive of the color of paper.
- Accent color: Light tan (#D19A51), slightly differentiated in brightness and saturation from the primary color, and serves as an additional analogous paper-like color.
- Font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif suitable for headlines and short chunks of text; if longer text is anticipated, choose 'Alegreya' for body text (both serif).
- Use simple, outlined icons where necessary, maintaining a consistent stroke width.
- Ensure a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions for a smooth user experience. Focus on paper-like animations (page turn, crumpling) where appropriate.
